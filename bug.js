This React Native bug manifests when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item render functions.  The issue arises from inefficient rendering and excessive re-renders, leading to performance degradation, especially on lower-end devices.  The app might become unresponsive, freeze, or crash.  The problem is exacerbated by frequent data updates or changes in component state.  Incorrect usage of `keyExtractor` or `renderItem` can further contribute to the problem.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <ComplexItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Might be missing or incorrect
/>
```
