# React Native FlatList Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a common performance problem encountered when using `FlatList` in React Native with large datasets and complex item components. The app may freeze or crash due to inefficient rendering.

## Problem

The primary issue is excessive re-renders caused by inefficient rendering and data updates in `FlatList`.  If the `keyExtractor` is not properly defined or the `renderItem` function is overly complex, the performance significantly degrades.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing the rendering process and utilizing techniques to improve `FlatList` performance. This includes using a more efficient `keyExtractor`, optimizing the `renderItem` function, using `getItemLayout` to improve scrolling, and implementing techniques to reduce the number of re-renders such as `React.memo` or `useMemo`.
